# The No-AI Software Directory

This repository will be a community-curated list of software and resources that explicitly avoid the integration of artificial intelligence.

## Criteria

To be included in this list, a project should meet **any one or more** of the following criteria:

* Explicitly "No-AI": The project's developers have made a public statement or have a clear philosophy against integrating AI features.

* AI-Free by default: The core functionality of the software does not include AI-driven features. While plugins may exist, they are not part of the default installation.

## Software Categories

* Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) & text editors:

  * [Vim](https://www.vim.org): A highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient.

  * [Neovim](https://neovim.io): A hyperextensible Vim-based text editor.

  * [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html): An extensible, customizable, free text editor and much more.

  * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com): A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. (Note: While some AI plugins exist, the core editor is AI-free).
 
* Office Suite

  * [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org): An open-source, privacy-oriented office suite that is developed and distributed without out-of-the-box AI functionality.
 
* Email Providers:
  
  * [Tutanota](https://tuta.com): A secure and private email service that offers end-to-end encryption for all data. Has a publicly stated policy against integrating AI features for privacy reasons. [[Link]](https://tuta.com/blog/no-ai-email)
 
 
* Social Networks:
  
  * [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org): It is a free and open-source software platform for decentralized social networking with microblogging features similar to Twitter. 
 
* Operating Systems:
  * [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org): Known for its source-based package management, offering a high degree of user control. It has a stated policy against AI-generated contributions.
 

## No-AI project policies & manifestos

> Coming up. I plan to list a collection of links to discussions, mailing list threads along with official policies from open-source and closed-source projects that have chosen to limit or ban AI-generated contributions.

## Community & further reading

> Coming up. Idea: Links to forums and other online communities where developers discuss traditional and AI-free development practices.

> Coming up. Idea: Articles and blog posts that explore the philosophy behind choosing a no-AI workflow.

## How to Contribute

Sure thing, you are welcome to contribute! The primary rule is to ensure any additions align with the no-AI philosophy of this repository.
